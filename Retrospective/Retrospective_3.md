# RETROSPECTIVE 3 (Team #2)

=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done
- Total points committed vs done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours Est. | Hours Actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #0    | 20      | -      | 47h        | 52h 52m      |
| #12   | 3       | 3      | 7h         | 11h          |
| #13   | 5       | 5      | 10h 30m    | 11h 25m      |
| #14   | 2       | 3      | 2h         | 2h 5m        |
| #26   | 2       | 5      | 7h         | 10h 25m      |
| #15   | 2       | 2      | 3h         | 4h 30m       |
| #27   | 7       | 5      | 10h 30m    | 7h 45m       |
| #16   | 1       | 2      | 1h 30m     | 55m          |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

  - Hours estimate per task average: 1.9, standard deviation: 1.24
  - Hours actual per task average: 2.17, standard deviation: 2.04

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0.12

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues
  - Hours spent on remediation
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
