# RETROSPECTIVE 3 (Team #2)

=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done
- Total points committed vs done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  |         | -      |            |              |
| n     |         |        |            |              |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues
  - Hours spent on remediation
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
- there was some inconsistencies in db and backend, this causes some problems

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
- we have tried to do a test-driven programming, despite some issue, we maneged to did our work 
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
-  i suggest to improve the test-driven approach wth better communication between front-end and back-end

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
-  We were able to complete a lot of story points
