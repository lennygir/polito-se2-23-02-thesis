# RETROSPECTIVE 4 (Team #2)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done:
- Total points committed vs done:
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team):

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours Est. | Hours Actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #0    |         |        |            |              |
|       |         |        |            |              |

|       |         |        |            |              |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

  - Hours estimate per task average: , standard deviation:
  - Hours actual per task average: , standard deviation:

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1:

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:

  - Total hours estimated: not estimated separately (as it is part of the DoD)
  - Total hours spent:
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:
  - Coverage:

- E2E testing:

  - Total hours estimated:
  - Total hours spent:

- Code review:

  - Total hours estimated:
  - Total hours spent:

- Technical Debt management:

  - Total hours estimated:
  - Total hours spent:
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube:
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues:
  - Hours spent on remediation:
  - Debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"):
  - Rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability):
    - Reliability: A
    - Security: A
    - Maintainability: A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
