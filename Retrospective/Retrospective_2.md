# RETROSPECTIVE 2 (Team #2)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
- Total points committed vs. done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours Est. | Hours Actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| #0    | 16      | -      | 57h 45m    | 71h 23m      |
| #5    | 1       | 2      | 2h         | 2h           |
| #6    | 1       | 2      | 30m        | 35m          |
| #7    | 1       | 2      | 2h         | 2h           |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

  - Hours estimate per task average: 2.16, standard deviation: 1.41
  - Hours actual per task average: 2.85, standard deviation: 2.21

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: -0.23

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
