# End 2 end testing

## Why end 2 end testing?

End 2 end testing is a way to test the application as a whole. We decided to use
this method to test the complex parts because it is the most realistic way to test
and it is the most efficient way to test the application.

   - Verify that all the proposals displayed have the selected filter
