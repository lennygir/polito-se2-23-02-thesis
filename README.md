## Project Description
Thesis Management is a specialized web platform created exclusively for the Polytechnic University of Turin to effectively oversee thesis-related processes. Within this application, students have the capability to explore available theses and submit their applications. Additionally, professors can contribute thesis proposals and review and decide on student applications. As of now, the system encompasses three primary user roles: professors, students, and secretary clerks. Each user is empowered to undertake various tasks aligned with their specific roles and permissions.

## Run in production

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Run

#### Using scripts

You can run the application by executing the scripts in the root folder:

```bash
# Linux and MacOS
./run_in_container.sh

# Windows
run_in_container.bat
```

#### Using docker commands
You can either retrieve the image from the docker hub either build it yourself.

If you want to build it execute the following commands:
```bash

# Build the frontend 
cd client && npm run build && cd ..

# Build the docker image 
docker build -t s321503/polito-thesis .

```

You can run the application by executing with the following command (don't forget to change the "SMTP password" variable) :

```bash

docker run \
  -p 80:80 -p 3000:3000 -p 5173:80 \
  --name polito-thesis \
  --rm \
  -e SMTP_HOST='smtp.gmail.com' \
  -e SMTP_PORT=465 \
  -e SMTP_USERNAME='thesis.se2.02@gmail.com' \
  -e SMTP_PASSWORD='<<SMTP password>>' \
  s321503/polito-thesis

```

and stop it with:

```bash

docker stop polito-thesis

```

Once the docker container is running you can access the application using [localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

## React Client Application Routes

- Route `/`: login page
- Route `/proposals`: students see the list of proposals for their cds, teachers see the list of their proposals
- Route `/proposals/:proposalId`: students see the details of a proposal and can apply to it, teachers can only see the proposal details
- Route `/add-proposal`: teachers can create a new proposal
- Route `/edit-proposal/proposalId`: teachers can edit an existing proposal
- Route `/applications`: students see the list of their applications, teachers see the list of applications to their proposals
- Route `/applications/:applicationId`: students see the check the details of an applications, teachers can also accept or reject an application
- Route `/notifications`: students and teachers see the list of notifications related to the proposals/applications
- Route `/settings`: users can change the theme and the current date
- Route `*`: non-existing routes view

## Client Components

### AccountPopover

This component, when rendered within a UI, would display a Chip containing the user's avatar, name, and role.
It pulls user information from a UserContext, and provides user details across the application.

### ApplicationDetails

This component is responsible for rendering details of a specific application, presenting student information, thesis proposal details, and handling actions such as accepting or rejecting an application (if the user's role is teacher).

If the user that has been signed in is a teacher, he/she can decide about accepting or rejecting an application (by using the buttons "accept" or "reject") on this page.
If the user is a student, he/she can view the message regarding his/her application. "application pending", "application rejected", "application accepted",  and "application canceled".

### ApplicationRow

This component is responsible for rendering a single row within a the application table, displaying application-related data based on the user's role.

If the user that has been signed in is a teacher, the data shown are student ID of who has applied for the proposal, the proposal title which she/he has applied for, and the status of the request, which could be in four ways: 1. Pending: if the application has neither been accepted or rejected by the teacher yet. 2. Accepted: If the application has been accepted by the teacher. 3. Rejected: If the application has been denied by the teacher. 4: Canceled: if the application has been accepted by the teacher for another student. The last content is view application, by clicking on it, the teachers can see the details of the application.

On the other hand, if the user is a student, the displayed data are the name and last name of the teacher who has been proposed the thesis, the proposal title which she/he has applied for, the status of the request, which could be in four ways: 1. Pending: if the application has neither been accepted nor rejected by the teacher yet. 2. Accepted: If the application has been accepted by the teacher. 3. Rejected: If the application has been denied by the teacher. 4: Canceled: if the application has been accepted by the teacher for another student. The last content is view application, by clicking on it, the students can see the details of their application.

### ApplicationTable

This component renders a table based on the provided data (`applications`) and the user's role fetched from the `UserContext`.

If the user's role is teacher, the rendered table headers will be "Student", "Proposal", "Status", "Open". 
On the contrary, if the user's role is student, the rendered table headers will be "Teacher", "Proposal", "Status", "Open"

### NotificationRow

This component is designed to generate individual rows for a table representing notifications or messages.
It receives a notification object as a prop containing specific information about each notification, such as its ID, object, content, and date.
For each notification passed into this component, it renders a row with three cells containing the object, content, and formatted date of the notification.

### NotificationTable

The NotificationTable component is designed to display a table of notifications.
It takes in an array of notification objects (data prop), each containing details like the notification's ID, object, message, and date.
For each notification in the data array, it generates a NotificationRow component to represent each notification in a row within the table.
The table includes headers for "Object", "Message", and "Date" to categorize the content.

### ProposalDetails

This component serves as an interface for users to view proposal details and take necessary actions related to applications based on their role and the status of existing applications. The component is designed to present comprehensive details of a proposal, including its title, supervisor, co-supervisors, type, keywords, groups, description, expiration date, level, CDS, and additional notes. It also handles actions related to submitting applications for proposals.

### ProposalFilters

This component is responsible for rendering a set of filters within a Material-UI `Drawer`. It provides options to filter proposal data based on various criteria.
The  drawer content consists of filter fields like types, groups, and date range.

### ProposalForm

It is used for creating or editing proposals. This component is designed to handle the creation and editing of proposals. It includes various input fields, validations, and logic to manage the proposal creation/update process. It also provides clear validation messages and prevents invalid submissions.

### ProposalRow

This component renders a single row in a table displaying information about a proposal. 
It encapsulates the rendering logic for a single proposal row in a table, providing options for different actions like editing, archiving, and deleting proposals based on user roles and proposal state.

### ProposalTable

This component is responsible for rendering a table displaying proposals. It accepts various props to manage data rendering and actions related to proposals.
This functional React component takes in several props that include headers, proposal data, functions to delete or archive a proposal, functions to fetch teacher details, filters, application data, and the current date.
It dynamically populates the table headers based on the user's role and the provided headers, and it renders each proposal using the `ProposalRow` component while passing necessary data and functions as props.


### RequestDetails

This RequestDetails component manages the display of detailed information about a student's request, especially concerning thesis supervision.

The component's main purpose is to present comprehensive details of a student's request for thesis supervision, including student information, supervisor details, and the request status. It also manages actions related to evaluating and responding to these requests.

### RequestForm

This component provides a form interface allowing users to input a thesis title, description, select a supervisor, and choose co-supervisors. It enables the creation of a request once the form is correctly filled and submitted. In addition, facilitates the selection of supervisors and co-supervisors from a predefined list of emails through Autocomplete components.

Overall, this component encapsulates a form for creating thesis-related requests with proper validation and data handling mechanisms.

### RequestRow

This component serves as a representation of a single row in a table displaying thesis-related requests. It showcases various details about the request, including its status, supervisor, title, and provides a convenient way to view the request details through the IconButton.

It focuses on presenting request-related data in a table format with navigational capabilities to view the details of a particular request.

### RequestTable

This component's primary purpose is to present a table displaying various details of requests related to thesis submissions, it arranges the information in a structured manner with columns for student details, supervisors, titles, request status, and an option to view the request details.
The "Status" column includes a tooltip legend for better understanding of the different statuses associated with requests.
By using the RequestRow component, it iterates through each request object to render rows in the table according to the defined headers.

### StudentCareerRow

StudentCareerRow component generates a row in a table, each row representing a specific course taken by a student.
It populates the cells of the row with data related to the course, such as the course code, title, grade, credits (CFU - Crediti Formativi Universitari), and the date of the course using the dayjs library for formatting the date.

### StudentCareerTable

This component generates a table displaying a student's academic career, with each row representing a course and each column displaying specific details about that course.
The table headers define what information is shown in each column (course code, exam name, grade, credits, and date).
For each course in the career array, the StudentCareerRow component is utilized to create a row in the table, populating it with course-related data.
